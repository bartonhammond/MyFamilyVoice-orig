=================


- Parse.com integration
-   User registration/login
-   Private user data
-   Class relations
-   ACL implementation
- Sample directive using non-angular JS plugins (WYSIWYG editor)
- Access rights to routes
- Other things that I found useful to learn that I can't think of right now

Installation:

The app is created with yeoman (http://yeoman.io/) so make sure you have grunt and bower installed.

- Clone the repository
- Change the Parse ApplicationID and REST API keys in app/scripts/app.js
- Move to the project directory and run the following commands
- npm install
- bower
- grunt serve

It should open a new tab in Chrome.
